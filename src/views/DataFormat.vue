        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of the source, each record returned consists of one <router-link to="#doi-object">DOI Object, </router-link> containing resource metadata. Each DOI Object in turn contains a list of zero or more <router-link to="#oa-location-object">OA Location Objects.</router-link>
        </p>






        <h2 class="anchor" id="doi-object">DOI object</h2>
        <p>The DOI object is more or less a row in our main database...it's everything we know about a given DOI-assigned resource, including metadata about the resource itself, and information about its OA status. It includes a list of zero or more <router-link to="#oa-location-object">OA Location Objects</router-link>, as well as a <code>best_oa_location</code> property that's probably the OA Location you'll want to use.</p>
