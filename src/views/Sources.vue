        <p>
            Unpaywall finds OA content in many ways, including using data from open indexes like Crossref and DOAJ where it exists. However, the majority of our OA content comes from independently monitoring over 50,000 unique online content hosting locations, including Gold OA journals, Hybrid journals, institutional repositories, and disciplinary repositories. You can search through our sources below, or
            <a href="https://api.oadoi.org/data/sources.csv">download the complete sources list.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you'd like to add your repository or journal to our list of sources, that's great! You can submit your repository for indexing via
            <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/HBOMqdSFOHEeFOwj1">
                this form,
            </a> and submit your journal <a href="mailto:team@impactstory.org">via email.</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you want to search for a particular source to see if we index it, check out the beta version of our <a
                href="https://unpaywall.org/sources">source search tool</a> on our old website. It's a little rough around the edges still, but should do the trick.
